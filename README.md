# Machine Learning Course on Coursera
**by Stanford University**
* Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)
* Link: [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for this course. All the code base and images, are taken from [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/).

*The topic of machine learning/artificial intelligence was of my interest since 2018. I took this course out of curiosity during coronavirus lockdown to take a deeper look at the topic and learn how to apply the concepts behind them. It had taken me around 2 months to get through and profoundly motivated me to develop my skills further.*
